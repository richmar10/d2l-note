A Note

## Install the Polymer-CLI

First, make sure you have the [Polymer CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/polymer-cli) and npm (packaged with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)) installed. Run `npm install` to install your element's dependencies, then run `polymer serve` to serve your element locally.

## Viewing Your Element

```bash
npm start
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

Your application is already set up to be tested via [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester). Run `npm test` to run your application's test suite locally.

## Versioning

Commits and PR merges to master will automatically do a minor version bump which will:
* Update the version in `package.json`
* Add a tag matching the new version
* Create a github release matching the new version

By using either **[increment major]** or **[increment patch]** notation inside your merge message, you can overwrite the default version upgrade of minor to the position of your choice.

## Localization

This repo uses [Serge](https://docs.dev.d2l/index.php/Serge-Localize) for localization. On any changes to langterm data files (eg. due to adding new lang terms, or merging an automated PR that provides updated translations), you must run
```bash
npm run localize
```
to generate new modules with the updated data.
